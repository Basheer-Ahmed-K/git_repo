Question 1

Step 1: Create a new Git repository.
        Created a repository here is the link https://github.com/Basheer-Ahmed-K/git_repo.git

Step 2: Create a file and commit changes.
        created a README.md file and committed

Step 3: View the commit history of your repository.
        Added a image to show the commit history

Step 4: Open the file you created earlier and make some changes to it. 
        Here I`m editing the changes with the README.md file

Step 5: Check the file you modified is now marked as "modified" and unstaged. 
Hint (git status)
        here also I`m added a image which show the "not staged for commit"

Step 6: Stage the changes you made to the file and commit the changes to the repository.

Step 7: Clone the repository you have created in GitHub.

Step 8: Fetch the changes, navigate into the cloned repository using the command line, and use the command git fetch to fetch any changes that have been made to the original repository since you cloned it.
        To perform this step I`m Changing this line

Step 9: Pull changes, merge the changes you just fetched into your local copy of the repository, and use the command git pull.
        This change is for pull
